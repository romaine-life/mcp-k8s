"""Inbound JWT verifier for auth.romaine.life-issued tokens.

mcp-k8s sits behind kube-rbac-proxy, which already gates on the
calling pod's K8s SA token. That tells us "some pod with an allowed
SA is talking to us" but carries no human identity. This module
verifies any Authorization: Bearer JWT the caller also presents, so
mcp-k8s learns who the call is for: a tank session's user, a
service principal, a bot-token-wielding admin, etc.

Auth.romaine.life is the platform's single IdP. Tokens are RS256-
signed with the IdP's KV-backed key; the public key set is published
at /api/auth/jwks. Verification: signature against JWKS, iss claim
matches the IdP, role claim is in the allowed closed set, exp not
passed.

The middleware in http.py runs this verifier on every inbound request,
optional: if no Authorization header is present, the caller stays as
"unknown" — kube-rbac-proxy is still gating who can connect. When a
JWT IS present, it must verify successfully or the request is rejected
with 401. (Half-trusting a malformed JWT would be worse than no JWT.)

This module is a direct copy of mcp-glimmung's auth_verifier.py with
the package path adjusted. The eventual home is a shared lib so the
four kube-rbac-proxy-gated MCPs (mcp-glimmung, mcp-k8s, mcp-argocd,
mcp-azure-personal) share one verifier implementation.
